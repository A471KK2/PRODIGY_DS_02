# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship - Task 02

## Task Description

Task 02 of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship involves creating visualizations to represent categorical or continuous distribution. The visualizations are developed using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, focusing on creating bar charts and line plots to effectively illustrate the data.

In this task, I have analyzed and visualized data from the Indian Super League (ISL) player dataset. The visualizations help in understanding the distribution and trends within the dataset.

## Visualizations

The following visualizations have been created:

1. **Number of Players by Country**:
   - A bar chart showing the distribution of players from different countries.

2. **Number of Tours by Players Name**:
   - A line plot showing the number of tours by each player's name.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: For making statistical graphics in Python.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this task is the "ISL Player Final" dataset.

## Visualizations Overview

### Bar Charts

- **Number of Players by Country**: This bar chart shows the distribution of players from different countries, helping to understand the diversity in the league.

### Line Plots

- **Number of Tours by Players Name**: This line plot illustrates the number of tours each player has participated in, providing insights into player activity.

## How to View the Visualizations

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Run the `analysis_script.py` file to generate and view the visualizations.

## Repository Structure

- **isl_player_final.csv**: This dataset contains the data used for the visualizations.
- **analysis_script.py**: This Python script contains the code for data analysis and visualization.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the task and how to use the repository.

## Getting Started

To get started with viewing the visualizations:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the necessary Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
4.Run the analysis_script.py script to generate the visualizations: PRODIGY_DS_02.ipynb

## Conclusion

This task was a great opportunity to apply data visualization techniques using Python. The created visualizations provide a clear and concise view of the categorical and continuous distributions within the dataset.
